Provide new port number in launch.json (2x) and in vite.config.js.
Add: 
server: {
        port: 5190,       // Assigned port number (default is 5173)
        port: 5191, ???       // Assigned port number (default is 5173)
        strictPort: true  // Because of CORS policy of the Server API
    },

created a new file: jsconfig.json to easier include imports.

Overall, this jsconfig.json configuration helps your editor understand
the structure of your React project, leading to a more efficient and 
streamlined development experience.  NOT Currently used, I think.

{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": "."
  },
  "include": [ "src" ]
}

Note that in main.jsx we have React.StrictMode.
 <React.StrictMode>
   <App />
 </React.StrictMode>,

By default, React enables "Strict Mode" during development. 
This mode intentionally double-renders components to help catch potential 
side effects and issues that might not be apparent in normal mode.

If the double rendering only happens in development due to Strict Mode, 
you can usually ignore it. The component should behave normally in production builds.
If necessary you can remove the component before going to production.

Also look at CORS settings in Server. Right now it accepts HTTP client.
We should configure React to run over HTTPS.
